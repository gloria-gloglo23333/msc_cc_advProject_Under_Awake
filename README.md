## Project concept
This a hyper-immersive VR game with gestures that focuses on "me" as a player gradually lost in a world where I can see, hear, smell and feel. The concept of the game draws on the idea of Inception movie, where the dream (or virtual world) is a sub-real world. There are many "NPC" consciousnesses that may seem friendly but ultimately aim to kill the player in order to take over the player's body and out of the "game space". The player needs to find the truth in all the seemingly plausible "game" routines to successfully wake up. But how easy is this? It is hard to escape once people are immersed in what they believe to be reality, as in Truman's world. Can you really find out what the truth is when your five senses are beginning to deceive you? Will you be able to escape once you know the so-called "truth"?

## Project log

### Week1-2 Research
#### -	Inspiration
After watching Fantastic Beasts 3 I just thought it was super cool, who doesn't have a magical dream!
#### -	Game review: ghost wire: Tokyo
Ghostwire: Tokyo is an action-adventure game played from a first-person perspective. The player can use various psychic and paranormal abilities to defeat the ghosts and spirits haunting Tokyo. Combat director Shinichiro Hara described the combat as "karate meets magic", as the player character utilizes hand movements inspired by Kuji-kiri hand gestures to cast spells. 
The graphics are very smooth throughout and I really like the special effects on the Japanese fear and Shinto and spell casting. However, I was actually disappointed when I actually played it, as the spell casting was actually more like a shooter, with flashy effects and long buttons to indicate the casting process.
#### -	Game review: In Verbis Virtus
In Verbis Virtus is a first-person game where the player uses a microphone to cast spells by actually reciting the incantation. It mixes action and puzzle elements in a fantasy setting. This is a game that was made a few years ago. It is a game where you can actually use your voice to cast spells. What struck me about this game was that it gave me a real feel for magic and the second world. It also made me decide to make a VR game that I could immerse myself in the experience.

### Week3-4 VR game playtest & concept making
#### -	VR chat

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73170220/204177144-01d45dca-b0f9-4554-9636-96e9499d544c.png)
 
VR chat might be the biggest VR chat room. VRChat offers an endless collection of social VR experiences by giving the power of creation to its community. Here I experienced teleport movement and horizontal（？）movement, and also discussed with friends which would give a more realistic feel to the movement, and came to the following conclusions:
-Normal movement causes 3d vertigo but is more realistic
-Teleport doesn't make you dizzy easily but feels weird.

#### -[Hogwarts Castle]（https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dlu0gziE1_8&t=736s）
This looks so great! It's low poly but there are lots of places to explore, the map is very large and cartoonish looking, not what I had in mind at first. But I can learn from it on the map. 

#### -	Magic world?
Yes! Trying to make a map that blends East and West and a world with magic!


### Week5 VR set up
#### -	UE test VR
This one really took me a lot of time, and at first it never worked…

### Week6 VR and Plug-in testing
#### -	VRExpansion
That works good!

#### -	InteractML
Tried few days... still struggled how to manage to add into VR, so give up quikly
#### -	Voice recogination
Can’t get it working!! Don’t know why and I couldn’t find the tutorial as well
#### -	Hand testing
That works good! But while moving is not work as I want it to. I need to set up a lot of extra posts for moving and jumping


### Week7 Concept reconsider
#### -	Inception
Inception is a film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a professional thief who steals information by infiltrating the subconscious of his targets. 
In this the idea is put forward that dreams are secondary realities where consciousness can be modified. Once the owner of the dream world thinks it is real he or she will be trapped in the dream forever, unable to distinguish between reality and the dream world. This inspired me, why don't I make a game so that people can experience this feeling too? The human brain is easily deceived. As long as all five senses feel "real", people will believe it is real, just like the theory of the brain in the tank.
#### -	Hyper- Immersive 
The above extends to a new word: immersion. Immersion is the ability to focus on the pleasure and satisfaction of the current target situation and forget about the real world situation. It is the degree of engagement, integration, vicariousness, the alternation of strong positive and negative emotions. I am going to use extended physical devices to extend people's immersion in VR
#### -	Game scene: Real? Or lowpoly
Real one, lowpoly deviated from my original intention of wanting to dream realistically

#### -	Mindmap

#### -	Storyline

"Me" as a player gradually lost in a world where I can see, hear, smell and feel. It is a place where you can learn magic, learn to fly and learn everything that doesn't make sense in reality. At first, “I” would think of it as a game, and I would choose the "NPC" gifts and quests as “I” pleased, but later “I” would feel more and more like it was a real world because that's what my five senses told “me”. But “I” didn't realise that it was all a trap and a false reality. The concept of the game draws on the idea of Inception movie, where the dream (or virtual world) is a sub-real world. In my setting, these scenes represent layers of consciousness for "me". There are many "NPC" consciousnesses that may seem friendly but ultimately aim to kill the player in order to take over the player's body and out of the "game space". The player needs to find the truth in all the seemingly plausible "game" routines to successfully wake up.

#### -	Moodboard about the scene
- Under the sea (represnting the player weak up in the dream)

- Castle (reprenting the player think this is the reality)

### Week8 building game world
#### -	Test1 failed 
What I wanted to do at first was to wake up from the deep (representing the subconscious) and then float up to the castle (representing floating from the deepest dream upwards in layers to the final layer of reality). But halfway through the reality layer it got stuck because I wanted to make an open map, so the map I made was too big to run in VR at all. As much as I liked it (below) I had no choice but to redo it.

### Week9-10 rewrite blueprinets and keep building scene
#### -	VRpawn to VRcharacter
I decided to ditch the teleportation in the original template in favour of a more realistic "walk", so I had to change the blueprint. I also had to convert the blueprints to VRCharacter again because I wanted to add flight mode and the VRPawn format was not available.

- Change into locomotion(left hand)

### Week11-12 fake water and trigger box

### Week13 Function testing with friends
#### -	q1: gesture not accurate
change the number of training data from 100+ -> 300+

#### -	q2: flying too fast
change the speed from 600 -> 400

#### -	q3: no NPC or other things could interact
adding 2 NPCs and dialoges

### Week14 hyper-immersive part start
#### -	Arduino test
Mainly testes the fan and the  water atomizer. But the atomizer mist too small and I give it up and change it in to servos.

### Week15 rebuild the project
I don't know why my project didn't open at all on one day... I've been unlucky enough to be scrambling for files all week, but luckily I had saved the previous version and had to do it all over again. (I still can't open the file until now :(


### Week16 connect serialcom plugin

### Week18 level transport and music
I discussed with my classmates about the whole process of the game again and found some areas that could be improved

#### -	BGM remix with LSTM model: Regenerate the bgm in scene Lost Castle – changed
This is an attempt, because in the last scene the player finds out that the so-called "truth" is that he is in a dream. Is it possible to use some music to represent some of the despair and shaken consciousness of "I"? So I used the RNN I used last semester to re-generate the bgm (based on [Coding3 final](https://github.com/gloria-gloglo23333/msc_cc_coding3_final)
